The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the specificity of selectors can lead to unexpected results.  The goal is to style both '.box' elements differently based on their position, but due to specificity issues, only the second '.box' element is styled, overriding the style for the first element. This is a common issue when using class selectors and id selectors together with the same property, for example, color. This kind of issue can happen also with other CSS properties like background, margin, etc.
